A dedicated “Version Control” page sounds useful for surfacing anomalies (multiple installed builds, mismatched manifests). You could populate it from the maintenance inventory, flag packages where installed ≠ highest available or when multiple install roots exist, and offer quick actions (uninstall, pin, refresh inventory).
If you move that data to the new page, consider trimming the maintenance view to exceptions only, so users aren’t re-reading healthy entries.
Next steps: 1) Sketch the data contract for the version-control view (fields, actions). 2) Decide how to detect duplicate installs (winget list output, registry, etc.). 3) Wire the UI once the backend exposes the query.
