a smart watch dog that sniffs logs for errors:

-our app can give lot of small silly errors:(the below are some i found go through the app and find more).
 0) we could also add a gendralised notification like if there was any error a option like view so they can view in logs.
 1) when user doesnt have latest version of powershell.
 2) when user installs scoop or choco, they have to restart the app for it to apply.

like this, if we see these(like for example installation form bootstrap page scoop), we show a small pop up like 
detected blah blah app restart required and a button to close and reopen the app.

for reference this is how if powershell newer version is not installed:
