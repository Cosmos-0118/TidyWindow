# Startup Controller Issues and Improvements

**Current rating:** 7/10

**Potential after fixes:** 9/10

## Key issues and recommended improvements

-   [ ] **No preview before delay/disable** – Delay and disable act immediately. Provide a confirmation sheet summarizing what will happen (source, target path/key, backup location) to avoid surprises on high-impact entries.
-   [ ] **Activity visibility is low** – Outcomes are logged to the Activity Log, but the page surface lacks per-entry success/failure/status after operations. Add inline status chips and a “view log” link for the last action.
