üí° The Secret Behind ‚ÄúInstant‚Äù File Search

NTFS Master File Table (MFT) Access

On Windows, every NTFS drive keeps a hidden table called the MFT ‚Äî it contains every file name, path, size, and metadata.

Tools like Everything read that table directly using low-level Windows APIs (like NtQueryDirectoryFile or FSCTL_GET_NTFS_VOLUME_DATA).

That gives them the entire list of files instantly, without walking through folders.

Live Update via Change Journals

Windows maintains a USN (Update Sequence Number) Journal, which logs every change (create, rename, delete).

Everything hooks into that ‚Äî so when you add, move, or delete a file, it updates its index in real time instead of rescanning.

In-Memory Index + Lightweight Trie Search

They store the index (all file names & paths) in RAM, often using a trie or B-tree structure for super-fast lookup.

Searching a prefix or substring just walks that tree ‚Äî lightning fast, like autocomplete on steroids.

Asynchronous I/O and Multi-Threading

Searches run on background threads, using async I/O, so you get results streaming live as you type.

‚öôÔ∏è How You Can Implement It in Your App

If your app‚Äôs going to do something similar, you can use a simpler architecture first:

At Startup:

Build an index by scanning the file system once (with a progress bar).

Save it as a small SQLite DB or JSON.

For Realtime Updates:

Hook into the USN Journal using C++ or C# (needs admin).

Or use FileSystemWatcher in .NET for basic real-time updates (simpler but slower).

For Speed:

Keep the index in memory during runtime (a dictionary/trie in Python, Java, or C#).

Use multi-threaded or async search.

Optional:

Cache search results and support filters (file type, modified date, etc.).
