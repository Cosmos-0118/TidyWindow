Prompt for an OpenRouter API key on the Cleanup page, store it securely, then fetch AI recommendations once saved.
Extend CleanupViewModel with API key storage, AI recommendation collection, busy/error state, and commands for saving the key, requesting suggestions, and applying them.
Update the Cleanup UI with a setup card, warning text, combined table of scan results plus AI advice, and an Apply Cleanup button.
Add IAiCleanupService and an OpenRouterCleanupService that call the OpenRouter chat completions API, parse JSON recommendations, and log interactions.
Define richer data contracts (CleanupCandidate, CleanupRecommendation), cap candidate payloads, and handle errors including invalid keys.
