✅ Accurate Breakdown (DeepSeek V3.1 670B)

Context window: 128,000 tokens

1 token ≈ 0.75 words → ~96,000 words total

1 token ≈ 4 characters → ~512,000 characters total

Pages:

~192 single-spaced (≈500 words/page)

~384 double-spaced (≈250 words/page)

Those conversions are perfectly reasonable approximations. Nothing wrong there.

⚠️ But here’s the “safe spot” you asked about:

Even though the theoretical limit is 128k tokens, you shouldn’t fill it completely if you want consistent performance and responses.
Because:

The model needs room for its own reply within that limit.

The closer you get to the full limit, the higher the risk of truncation, slow processing, or degraded reasoning.

So the safe usable range is around:

🔹 90,000–100,000 tokens max for input
🔹 Keep at least 25–30k tokens free for output and reasoning.

That’s roughly 70,000–75,000 words safe (about a long nonfiction book).
If you go beyond that, the model might skip parts of your input or give incomplete outputs.

💡 Best practice

If you’re feeding a huge document:

Chunk it into smaller parts (like 50k tokens per chunk).

Ask the model to summarize or analyze each chunk, then merge results.

Keep the core prompt short and structured.
