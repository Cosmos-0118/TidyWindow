steps likely don't need for personal use, along with explanations why:

Steps 18.1 to 18.5: Testing & Quality Gates
Extensive unit and automation testing, static analysis, and nightly tests are critical for team projects or production apps but overkill for personal projects where informal testing often suffices.

Steps 14.1 to 14.5: Plugin System Foundation
Plugin architecture enables third-party extensions, valuable for community-driven or commercial apps but irrelevant if you don’t plan to create or support plugins.

Steps 16.1 to 16.5: Telemetry & Diagnostics
Collecting telemetry and diagnostic data is useful for improving the app based on user feedback, but generally unnecessary if you’re the sole user, plus it raises privacy considerations.

Steps 10.1 to 10.5: Integrity & Threat Checks
Advanced security scans and heuristic analysis are more important in enterprise or multi-user environments than a personal app where you control the system.

Steps 11.1 to 11.5: Privilege & Deployment
Complex privilege management and multiple deployment formats are required for distributing and running apps across varied environments; personal use usually involves a single environment.

Steps 20.1 to 20.5: Open Preview Release
Pre-release verification, feedback collection, and QA checklists are essential for public releases but irrelevant for personal, non-distributed projects.

Steps 21.1 to 21.5: 1.0 Stabilization
Final release refinements, telemetry triage, and post-launch retrospectives target polished public software rather than personal projects which can remain in flexible development.
