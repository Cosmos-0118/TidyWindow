  "summary": "##  Cleanup & Deep Scan Safety + Responsiveness\n\n###  Installer & UI Responsiveness\n- Added `/NORESTARTAPPLICATIONS` to installer launch so Restart Manager no longer auto-restarts TidyWindow (fixes ghost “Setup” in Alt-Tab)\n- Preview hydration now stays **off the UI thread**, batching work with `Task.Yield` to keep setup->preview smooth\n- Deletion phases yield more frequently to keep confirmation -> deletion -> celebration transitions responsive\n\n---\n\n###  System Path Safety (Major Hardening)\n- Introduced shared **CleanupSystemPathSafety** classifier for OS-critical paths\n- Cleanup and Deep Scan now rely on the shared classifier (old ad-hoc root checks removed)\n- Explicit validation added: null/empty paths, traversal detection, safe normalization, root-only checks\n- Supports runtime extension of protected roots\n- Added comprehensive unit tests for critical, traversal, and edge cases\n\n---\n\n###  Deep Scan Guardrails\n- Added **Allow system paths (dangerous)** toggle for scanning, with confirmation and hazard styling\n- Added **Allow system deletions (dangerous)** toggle for deletion, fully independent from scanning\n- System paths are:\n  - Skipped during scan unless explicitly allowed\n  - **Always blocked from deletion** unless system deletions are enabled\n- Status messages clearly report when protection blocks actions\n- Removed old “System” filter and grouped dangerous options together\n\n---\n\n###  Delete Flow Improvements\n- Both normal and force delete now block when system deletion is disabled\n- Lower-level delete helpers enforce system-path gating consistently\n- Added per-item delete progress:\n  - “Deleting…” state with indeterminate progress bar\n  - Delete/Force Delete buttons disable while active\n- Force delete continues to honor ownership, retry, and delete-on-reboot logic\n\n---\n\n###  PathPilot & Cleanup Stability\n- Inventory refresh and switch operations run in background tasks with **timeouts + linked cancellation**\n- Navigation cancels in-flight work to prevent lingering load\n- Centralized cancellation management ensures clean disposal",
