Clear restrictive attributes\n  2. Standard delete\n  3. Take ownership & grant full control\n  4. Close file handles via Restart Manager\n  5. Tombstone rename + delete\n  6. Depth-first directory purge\n  7. Reboot scheduling (last resort only)\n\n### Fixed False Space Reporting\n- Resolved cases where preview size didn’t match actual freed space.\n- Only verified deletions count toward reclaimed space.\n- Pending reboot items are no longer counted as freed.\n\n### Pending Reboot Awareness\n- New **PendingReboot** deletion state.\n- UI now clearly shows:\n  - Verified reclaimed space\n  - Items pending removal after restart\n- Accurate messaging sets correct user expectations.\n\n---\n\n## Cleanup Coverage Expansion\n\n- Cleanup definitions expanded to **350+ targets**, covering:\n  - System, Windows Update, browsers, messaging apps\n  - Developer tools, gaming platforms, media apps\n  - Creative software, cloud storage, virtualization\n  - AI/Copilot/Recall data, WebView2 caches\n  - OEM residue and driver installers\n- UWP and WebView2 targets are discovered dynamically.\n\n### Safe-First Cleanup Model\n- Redesigned safety rules:\n  - Explicit allowlist for known-safe system paths\n  - Strict protection for critical OS components\n  - Immutable protection for boot, kernel, and registry hive files\n\n---\n\n## Navigation & Page Caching Architecture\n\n### New Navigation Lifecycle Interface\n- Introduced `INavigationAware` for cached pages:\n  - `OnNavigatedTo()` – restore state, reattach handlers\n  - `OnNavigatingFrom()` – cleanup transient state\n\n### Smarter Page Cache (LRU-K)\n- Replaced simple LRU with **LRU-K (K=2)**:\n  - Retains frequently visited pages longer\n  - Filters correlated rapid accesses\n  - Cache size increased from 4 → 6 pages\n- Navigation service now triggers lifecycle callbacks correctly.\n\n### Scroll & Title Bar Restoration Fixes\n- Fixed scroll-to-top and stale scroll viewer references.\n- Title bars now reliably restore on cached page re-navigation.\n- Prevented cached pages from detaching required navigation events.\n\n---\n\n## Startup Controller – UX & Control Improvements\n\n### Clearer Controls\n- Replaced Enable/Disable dual buttons with:\n  - **Turn On** (green)\n  - **Turn Off** (red)\n- Added **Turn Off & Stop Now** action to immediately terminate running processes.\n- Renamed **Guard → Keep Disabled** with clearer explanation.\n\n### Filters & Layout\n- Converted large inline filter section into a compact popup.\n- Category-grouped filters with icons and pill-style buttons.\n- Improved spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy.\n\n### Service Recovery Restoration\n- Fully restores original Windows service recovery options:\n  - Restart delays\n  - Run-process actions\n  - Reboot actions\n- Parses and reconstructs original `sc failure` configuration accurately.\n\n---\n\n## Threat Watch – Precision Fixes\n\n- Threat Watch now flags **only unsigned startup entries in risky locations**.\n- System folders are explicitly excluded.\n- Removed overly aggressive unsigned-entry rule.\n- Clear severity levels:\n  - **RED** – Temp locations\n  - **YELLOW** – User workspace locations\n  - **OK** – System / Program Files\n\n---\n\n## UI Modernization & Visual Quality\n\n### Performance Lab Redesign\n- Larger, modern cards with improved spacing and typography.\n- Clear status chips instead of tiny indicators.\n- Modern toggle controls with explicit state indicators.\n- Cleaner dialogs, overlays, and action buttons.\n- Improved color palette and contrast.\n\n### Icon & Text Quality\n- Replaced all emoji icons with **Segoe Fluent vector icons**.\n- Crisp rendering at all DPI levels.\n- Consistent alignment, sizing, and coloring.\n\n### Processes Page Optimization\n- Reduced XAML size by ~37%.\n- Removed GPU-heavy effects.\n- Unified color system, typography, buttons, and chips.\n- Cleaner structure across Catalog, Settings, and Threat Watch views.",
