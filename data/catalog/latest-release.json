  "summary": "##  SFC Timeout & Runspace Fix\n\n- Fixed false **SFC /scannow timeouts** caused by a stdout/stderr buffering deadlock in `Invoke-NativeWithTimeout`\n- Output is now **streamed while the process runs** and remaining buffers are drained before reading `ExitCode`\n- Prevents pipe buffer saturation that previously blocked SFC from exiting\n\n###  Runspace Safety\n- Removed async stdout/stderr event logging that ran on background threads\n- Output is now captured, awaited, and logged **on the main runspace thread**\n- Eliminates runspace errors during native process execution",
