  "summary": "##  Driver Cleanup & Backup Enhancements\n\n- Added **DriverBackupRetentionDays** (default 30) with validation and persisted storage\n- Implemented **Cleanup-DriverBackups** to prune backup folders older than the retention window\n- On startup, auto-create backup folder (if configured) and prune stale backups immediately\n\n###  Safe Driver Removal\n- Non-present drivers older than the configured age (default 30 days) are removed automatically\n- Recent or date-unknown packages are skipped with clear reporting\n- Optional export: if `-DriverBackupPath` is set, drivers are backed up via `pnputil /export-driver` before deletion\n\n###  Metadata + Binding Checks\n- Lookup added for **date / version / provider / class** per driver\n- Added **Test-DriverBindingsPresent** using `Get-PnpDevice`\n  - Only remove when **all bindings are non-present**\n  - Unresolved bindings treated as present for safety\n  - Binding lists kept array-typed end-to-end\n\n###  Robust pnputil Handling\n- Detects unsupported/help output and avoids false logs\n- Falls back to WMI when pnputil is ambiguous or exits non-zero\n- Only logs pnputil lines when real device/package data is present",
