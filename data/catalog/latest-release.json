  "summary": "## Fixed the build error.\n\n##  Startup Control & Performance Lab UX\n\n###  Startup Backup & Restore\n- Added **proactive backups** for Run/RunOnce entries so they can always be restored, even if deleted or renamed.\n- UI and service now share the **same backup store**, preventing mismatched or missing restore sources.\n- Added helpers that recover entries by **value name**, not just ID, improving restore reliability.\n- Startup enable falls back to the backup store before failing - no more “No data to restore.”\n- Toggle actions now **refresh commands, counters, and paging instantly**, so you can re-toggle without manual refresh.\n\n###  Visibility & Messaging\n- Logging now includes **action, entry name, source tag, user context, and registry/task path** for immediate clarity.\n- Status chips now distinguish “detected” vs “in effect” - detects stay visible without falsely reporting success.\n\n###  Guardrails & Automation\n- Added **DisableAutomationCommand** to turn off boot automation + auto-tune monitoring in one click.\n- Introduced “**arm tweaks**” guard and automation kill switch UI - apply buttons stay locked until armed.\n- Boot automation “Run Now” and all tweak actions now require the guard lock to prevent accidental changes.\n- All write/restore actions are **guard-locked**, with updated `CanExecute` logic for safe UI flow.\n\n###  UI Touch-Up\n- Improved side-bar.",
