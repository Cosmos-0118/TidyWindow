  "summary": "# Release Notes\n\n## Major Stability & Architecture Improvements\n\n### Startup Controller – Backup-Aware Management\n- Added **backup-only startup entries** for items that no longer exist in the live system but are preserved in backups.\n- Backup-only entries are clearly marked with an amber **“Backup only”** badge.\n- Enable/Disable actions are disabled for backup-only items to prevent invalid operations.\n- New actions for backup-only entries:\n  - **Restore from backup** – Recreates the startup item safely.\n  - **Delete backup** – Permanently removes the backup with confirmation.\n- Backup-only filter toggle with live count indicator.\n\n### Robust Backup & Restore Flow\n- StartupFolder entries now move shortcut files (`.lnk`, `.url`) to a managed backup directory instead of deleting.\n- Backup records store both original and backup file paths for safe restoration.\n- Restore logic handles conflicts safely:\n  - If destination already exists, backup is cleaned up without overwriting.\n- Automatic cleanup of:\n  - Stale backups where neither original nor backup file exists.\n  - Orphaned backups when apps recreate their startup entry after being disabled.\n- Full deduplication across ViewModel, store, and UI layers (case-insensitive IDs).\n- Backup store is thread-safe and self-healing on refresh.\n\n---\n\n## Startup Reliability & Guarding\n\n### False “Re-enabled” Warning Fix\n- Fixed incorrect warnings caused by backups being created for enabled entries.\n- Backups are now created **only for disabled startup items**, ensuring warnings are accurate.\n\n### In-App Re-enabled Alerts\n- Added visible UI alert when non-guarded startup entries re-enable themselves.\n- Alert includes:\n  - Clear warning message with affected entries\n  - Dismiss action\n- Detailed activity log entries retained for auditability.\n\n---\n\n## Run at Startup & Background Mode\n\n### App Auto-Start (Multi-Strategy)\n- Reliable startup registration using multiple fallbacks:\n  1. Task Scheduler XML task (preferred)\n  2. `schtasks` CLI fallback\n  3. Registry Run key fallback (non-admin safe)\n- New `IsEnabled` verification checks actual registration state.\n- Automatic cleanup ensures only one startup mechanism remains active.\n- Improved error detection and diagnostics.\n\n### System Tray Resilience\n- Tray icon automatically recovers after Explorer restarts.\n- Health check timer validates tray icon presence in background mode.\n- Retry logic with controlled backoff.\n- Thread-safe tray operations and full disposal cleanup.\n\n---\n\n## Threat Watch Accuracy Improvements\n\n### Safer Detection Logic\n- Threat Watch now **only flags unsigned startup entries**.\n- Explicitly skips system directories:\n  - Windows\n  - System32\n  - SysWOW64\n- Removed overly aggressive “unsigned startup” catch-all rule.\n- New severity rules:\n  - **RED** – Unsigned startup from temp locations\n  - **YELLOW** – Unsigned startup from user workspaces (Downloads, Desktop, Documents)\n  - **OK** – Unsigned entries in system or Program Files locations\n\n---\n\n## UI & UX Refinements\n\n### Startup Controller\n- Removed drop shadow hover effects to prevent card movement.\n- Hover state now only changes border color for a stable layout.\n- Cleaner backup actions with clear destructive styling for delete.\n\n### Performance Lab – Complete Redesign\n- Modern, lightweight full-width layout.\n- Clean step cards with:\n  - Number badge\n  - Title\n  - Status dot\n  - 1–2 aligned action buttons\n- Controls moved to hero header for clarity.\n- Minimal status indicators instead of verbose chips.\n- Compact info dialogs and refined button sizing.\n- Improved visual hierarchy and consistency across steps.\n\n### Logs & Settings Pages\n- Logs page redesigned with:\n  - Two-column layout (entries + details)\n  - Color-coded severity badges and emoji indicators\n  - Virtualized list for performance\n- Settings page modernized:\n  - Card-based layout\n  - Modern toggles with accent styling\n  - Simplified chips and overlays\n  - Reduced complexity (~60% fewer lines)\n\n---\n\n## Feature Scope Adjustments\n\n### Latency Guard (Removed)\n- Latency Guard feature was fully removed due to instability.\n- All related pages, services, samplers, tests, DI registrations, and navigation references were deleted to keep the codebase clean.\n\n---\n\n## Expanded Coverage & Capabilities\n\n### Known Processes Catalog\n- Expanded from ~95 to ~190 entries.\n- Added 7 new categories including AI, Accessibility, Media, Network, Security Extras, and OEM bloatware.\n\n### Startup Sources\n- Startup Controller now supports **22 startup source kinds**, including:\n  - LSA Providers\n  - Shell Extensions\n  - Winsock Providers\n  - Browser Helper Objects\n  - Font Drivers\n  - Known DLLs\n  - Print Monitors\n\n### Cleanup System\n- Cleanup coverage expanded to **100+ targets**:\n  - Windows upgrade residue\n  - AI/Copilot/Recall data\n  - Browsers, messaging apps, developer tools\n  - GPU caches, game launchers, cloud storage\n  - Virtualization platforms, UWP apps, peripherals\n- Automation scripts updated to match full UI coverage.",
