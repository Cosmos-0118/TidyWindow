its a simple idea but very powerful:

a app uninstaller page:

-detects literally all apps instralled in the system even hidden ones - a proper search.

- and gives a option to delete apps. literally selete everything related to app. even thing there should be no trace of app eben existed.

- take inspiration form cleanup page. just to get a idea on the ui.
