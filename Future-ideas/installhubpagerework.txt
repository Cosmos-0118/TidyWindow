Install Hub Rework Notes (grounded in current implementation)
-----------------------------------------------------------

What we have today (src/TidyWindow.App/Views/InstallHubPage.xaml + InstallHubViewModel)
- One monolithic page renders bundles, individual packages, and the live queue simultaneously. Heavy XAML (two complex ListViews, drawer, overlay) plus dozens of entrance animations → dropped frames on mid-spec machines.
- Queue state management is solid (InstallQueue snapshot sync, overlay throttling) but the UI does not take advantage of it: everything is always visible, so virtualization rarely kicks in and small window sizes feel cramped.
- Essentials page already solves responsive layout with column breakpoints and a dedicated secondary surface. We can borrow that pattern.

Goals for the rework
1. Make the hub task-oriented: “Curate bundles” vs “Browse full catalog” vs “Review queue/history.”
2. Improve performance: remove decorative animations, rely on virtualization, keep only the existing loading overlay (already rate-limited to 1.2s min).
3. Auto-resize gracefully like Essentials: vertical stack on narrow widths, split view on wide monitors, queue panel collapses into a button.
4. Reduce cognitive load—only show the data relevant to the step the user is on.

Proposed UX flow (mirrors Cleanup’s multipage/pivot pattern)
- **Page 1 – Bundles & quick actions**
	- Hero text (keep `_headline` binding: “Curate developer bundles”).
	- Cards for curated bundles (everything except the synthetic “All packages”). Each card shows count, highlights “updated recently,” and surfaces “Queue bundle” + “View details.”
	- “Browse catalog” button leads to Page 2. Also surface “View queue (n)” chips that open the queue view.
- **Page 2 – Catalog browser**
	- Full `Packages` collection with search, filters (bundle dropdown, vendor tags) and multi-select queueing (we already support `QueueSelection`).
	- Layout toolbelt: left column = filters, right = virtualized grid. Reuse Cleanup page’s responsive breakpoints so cards resize rather than wrap unpredictably.
	- Provide “Add to queue” inline plus context on install size/source if we have it.
- **Page 3 – Queue & history**
	- Dedicated view for `Operations`. Show active installs, recently completed, retries. Reuse `InstallOperationItemViewModel` template but inside its own page so we can expand details without crushing bundle cards.
	- Expose actions already on the VM: retry failed, clear completed, cancel.

Responsive behavior & layout system
- Use a `TransitioningContentControl` or `Frame` to host the three logical pages; navigation via tabs or header chips. Only the overlay retains animation.
- Apply Essentials-style `AdaptiveGrid` helpers (or recreate with `VisualStateManager`) to switch between single-column, two-column, and split-drawer layouts based on width thresholds (e.g., <900px single column).
- Queue drawer: on wide screens it docks to the right; on narrow screens it becomes a floating button that opens Page 3.

Animation and polish plan
- Remove all `Storyboard` entrance animations defined in `InstallBundleCardItemStyle`, `InstallPackageCardItemStyle`, and `InstallQueueItemStyle`. Replace with static visuals + maybe subtle hover states (already there).
- Keep only the loading overlay animation (already controlled by `OverlayMinimumDuration`).
- Add skeleton/loading placeholders for bundles and packages instead of fade/translate sequences.

Implementation sketch
1. Split `InstallHubPage` XAML into user controls: `InstallHubBundlesView`, `InstallHubCatalogView`, `InstallHubQueueView`. Each control consumes the same `InstallHubViewModel`.
2. Introduce a `CurrentPivot` enum in the view model (or reuse `_selectedBundle`/`_headline`) so navigation is state-driven and testable.
3. Cull animation resources; ensure ListView/GridView use `VirtualizingStackPanel` with `IsVirtualizing="True"` and `VirtualizationMode="Recycling"`.
4. Adopt Essentials’ sizing helpers (check `Views/EssentialsPage.xaml` for reference) to make cards auto-resize.
5. After layout changes, profile with Perforator or WPF Visual Profiler to confirm no dropped frames when scrolling 150+ packages.

Opportunities while we are here
- Surface queue telemetry already tracked in `_activePackageCounts` (e.g., badge the bundle cards showing how many installs are already running from that bundle).
- Add empty states per page: “No bundles yet,” “No packages match filters,” “Queue is empty” to reduce confusion.
- Consider persisting last pivot so power users land on Catalog by default.

Result: Install Hub becomes a calm, staged experience comparable to Cleanup, keeps the robust backend we already have, and ditches the glitchy animation stack.
