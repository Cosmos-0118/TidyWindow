Driver Updates Page — reality check and proposal
------------------------------------------------

What we already have
- Backend is `automation/essentials/driver-update-detect.ps1`. It inventories every installed driver via `Win32_PnPSignedDriver`, then asks Windows Update (WU) for pending driver updates (`Microsoft.Update.Session`, `Type='Driver'`).
- Script normalizes driver classes, vendors, hardware IDs, and can filter by include/exclude vendor/class lists. Optional updates can be surfaced with `-IncludeOptional`.
- Output is structured JSON with the detected updates plus our local inventory, so the UI can already show: device name, manufacturer, current vs offered version/date, classification, optional flag, and skip reasons.

Why the current page feels useless
- UI today only repeats "Windows already handles this" instead of surfacing the context-rich JSON we generate.
- There is no action surface: no way to install, defer, or ignore updates; no explanations of why something was filtered; no remediation (rollback/reinstall) hooks.
- GPU-specific expectations (AMD/NVIDIA) are unmet, so users assume the feature is broken even though WU is sometimes empty.

Concrete improvements
1. Visualize our data: list each detected driver with badges for `UpdateAvailable`, `PotentialDowngrade`, optional, vendor, class. Include the skip reasons from the JSON so filters feel intentional.
2. Offer an "Install via Windows Update" button per driver set. Implementation: call WU installer (`Microsoft.Update.Session.CreateUpdateInstaller`) against the IDs our detector already returns. Respect filters/optional toggles.
3. Add a "Reinstall from local INF" action. We can locate the currently installed INF (already exposed as `installedInfPath`) and run `pnputil /add-driver <inf> /install /reboot` or `pnputil /reinstall-driver <hwid>` on Windows 11 24H2+. For older builds, pair `pnputil /delete-driver` with `pnputil /add-driver` and force a rescan.
4. GPU vendor coverage: WU cannot guarantee latest Radeon/GeForce packages. Two options:
	- Light-weight: link out to AMD Adrenalin and NVIDIA GeForce Experience with explanatory text when we detect those vendors.
	- Ambitious: integrate vendor CLIs. AMD exposes `setup.exe -install -quiet -logpath ...`; NVIDIA provides `setup.exe -s -noreboot`. We can download those only when the hardware class is `Display` and vendor strings match, but this needs EULA review and large downloads.
5. Health insights: bubble devices with `DeviceProblemCode` or unsigned drivers to give the page a troubleshooting purpose even when WU has nothing pending.

Answering the open questions
- "Can we check/install AMD or NVIDIA drivers?" We can detect them today (class `Display`, vendor name match). Installing third-party packages automatically is possible but requires bundling vendor installers or orchestrating their web APIs; the safer MVP is still WU install + launch-official-installer workflow.
- "Can we reinstall drivers using Windows?" Yes. Windows ships `pnputil`, `devcon` (optional), and `DISM /Online /Remove-Driver`. We already know the INF path and hardware IDs, so wiring a reinstall/reset button is feasible without third-party bits.

Next actions
- Build a thin UI layer around the JSON payload to expose detections, filters, and optional updates.
- Implement the WU install + pnputil reinstall commands in a helper script, then call it from the page.
- Add GPU-specific messaging so users understand when WU has nothing to offer and where to fetch vendor packages.
