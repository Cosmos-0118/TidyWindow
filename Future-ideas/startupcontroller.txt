during startup:
lot of startup apps run at the same time and make system lag.

is there a way to run startup apps one by one. so we use less cpu and less lag?

but before that our app should be the first one to startup after boot.or reboot.

create a dedicated page for this. also show all the apps that run in startup so user can set priority.

amd user can give them numberw like 1 - 2 - 3. so in that order we startup apps.

user can also set to ignore app if its very important.

so by this with a simple toggle user can control all startup apps.
